In this project, I analyzed store data to uncover key insights and trends. I performed data cleaning by handling null values, dropping duplicates and unnecessary columns, and transforming date formats to extract years, months, and days. Dimensionality reduction was applied to simplify the target column, optimizing computations. Correlation analysis using the Chi-Squared test revealed relationships between features, and visualizations highlighted patterns in cities, regions, and temporal data. This project demonstrates essential skills in data preprocessing, statistical testing, and visualization for actionable insights.
